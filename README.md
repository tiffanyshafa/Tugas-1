Here are the things i usually use:

- 1 Oatside Oat Milk 200ml 🥛

## How to Make ⋆˙⟡
1. Put 1 sachet of Nescafe Ice Roast 2gr into a mug. (Sometimes when i want the coffee to be stronger, i use 2 sachets.)

3. Stir well.
4. Add some ice cubes
5. Pour in 200ml of Oatside Oat Milk. (I like it not too sugary, and this milk already sweet enough!)
6. My kind of everyday coffee is ready to boost my energy!!☕✨
